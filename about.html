            <p>Agustina Smith can't stop thinking about doing lots of things. Days aren't long enough to fit all her passions. In an alternate universe, she is an expert in paraguayan food, a dj, a contemporanean dancer and a humorist. All at once.</p>
            <p>In this particular point of the space-time continuum, she's a 2D animator, illustrator and motion grapher. She makes characters come to life in amazing videoclips. She's inspired by japanese animation, nature, costumes and pop culture. She also has a side project called Poror√≥, and a virtual animation festival called Nite Lite Club.</p>
            <p>You can find her on instagram (@_gualicha_), fighting to save the environment with amazing graphics. Also, you can email her. She'll get in touch, even if she's getting brunch in another dimension.</p>
